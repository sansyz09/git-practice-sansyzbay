**Repository created on:** [Today's Date]
```

**How to create the file:**
```bash
# Using nano editor
nano README.md

# Copy the template above, customize it with your information
# Save: Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter
```

### Step 3: First Commit (5 points)

```bash
# 1. Add README.md to staging area
git add README.md

# 2. Check status
git status

# 3. Make your first commit
git commit -m "Add personal README with DevOps learning goals"

# 4. Check commit history
git log --oneline
```

**Expected output:**
```
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   README.md

[main (root-commit) abc1234] Add personal README with DevOps learning goals
 1 file changed, 25 insertions(+)
```

### Step 4: Create .gitignore File (3 points)

Create a `.gitignore` file to ignore common files that shouldn't be tracked:

```bash
# Create .gitignore file
nano .gitignore
```

**Content for .gitignore:**
```
# Operating System Files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Editor Files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo
*~

# Temporary Files
*.tmp
*.temp
*.log

# Personal Notes (private files)
personal-notes.txt
secrets.txt

# Python Files (for future use)
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo

# Node.js Files (for future use)
node_modules/
npm-debug.log
```

### Step 5: Second Commit (2 points)

```bash
# 1. Add .gitignore to staging area
git add .gitignore

# 2. Check status
git status

# 3. Make your second commit
git commit -m "Add .gitignore for common file types"

# 4. Check commit history
git log --oneline
```

**Expected output:**
```
abc1234 Add .gitignore for common file types
def5678 Add personal README with DevOps learning goals
```
